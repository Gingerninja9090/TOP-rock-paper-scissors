# TOP-rock-paper-scissors

# First Phase (Inital Build)
## Assignment-Outlines

Create a simple game (rock-paper-scissors) that runs using javascript
Follow the guideline to assist in creating said game (Assingment guideline on The Odin Project Website)
Game will be run within the console, no visual/GUI will be used

## Personal-Notes

Created a rock-paper-scissors game that runs for 5 rounds
Game is played within the console using prompt for input for user and alert to display outcome
Redid the inital code as I lacked good understanding of functions and code was not setup correctly to handle loop
After researching and through trial and error, gained a better understanding and resulted in a better experince in coding
Managed to code the game to operate as expected, 11/10 would pull hair out again because lack of understanding and experince
Left in pseudocode to show thought process

# Second Phase (Revise Build + UI function)
## Assignment-Outline

Revise/update the rock paper scissors game created earlier in the course
The goal was to create a UI and additional functions utlizing DOM mainly to create a functional UI that can play rock paper scissors
A guideline was given and followed additonally to this assignment is the use of branching function within git

## Personal-Notes

This looked like a large undertaking more so with the large gap of abscence, however this was quickly the most fun and tough work load
While the guide assisted greatly, most of the knowledge and reasoning was done through testing, google and trial and error 
While the UI is basic and not very nice looking, I will be coming back to update and add to this when I gain more knowledge
