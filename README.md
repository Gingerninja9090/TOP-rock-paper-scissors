# Personal-Notes

Created a rock-paper-scissors game that runs for 5 rounds
Game is played within the console using prompt for input for user and alert to display outcome
Redid the inital code as I lacked good understanding of functions and code was not setup correctly to handle loop
After researching and through trial and error, gained a better understanding and resulted in a better experince in coding
Managed to code the game to operate as expected, 11/10 would pull hair out again because lack of understanding and experince
Left in pseudocode to show thought process
